# Overview

For this project I wanted to practice writing code that would allow me to work with a database through the use of functions. This would help reduce typing long repetative commands by only having to call a function with a few paramaters. 



{Important!  Do not say in this section that this is college assignment.  Talk about what you are trying to accomplish as a software engineer to further your learning.}

{Provide a description the software that you wrote and how it integrates with a SQL Relational Database. Describe how to use your program.}

{Describe your purpose for writing this software.}

{Provide a link to your YouTube demonstration.  It should be a 4-5 minute demo of the software running, a walkthrough of the code, and a view of how created the Relational Database.}

# Future Work


* Second table with appointment information which can join with customers to keep track of when each customer was seen last.
* A function that allows for adding more columns to a table such as a timestamp.
* A function to show the user specific data from mulitple tables.
